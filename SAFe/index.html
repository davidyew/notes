<div id="4 SAFe Core Values-2. Built-in Quality-5 dimensions-1. Establish Flow"><h4 id="1. Establish Flow" class="header"><a href="#4 SAFe Core Values-2. Built-in Quality-5 dimensions-1. Establish Flow">1. Establish Flow</a></h4></div>
<p>
Creating flow requires eliminating the traditional sequential phase gates planning and execution that hinder progress. 
Instead, teams visualize and focus their efforts on smaller deliverables to shepherd new pieces of functionality from ideation to an on-demand release of value to the end user. 
Unlike traditional project management, where success is measured by completing an entire initiative on time and on budget, 
Agile teams quickly release small deliverables to learn and adapt, basing success on objective evaluation. 
Small features flow through the system quickly to provide feedback and allow course correction.
</p>

<div id="4 SAFe Core Values-2. Built-in Quality-5 dimensions-2. Pairing and Peer Review"><h4 id="2. Pairing and Peer Review" class="header"><a href="#4 SAFe Core Values-2. Built-in Quality-5 dimensions-2. Pairing and Peer Review">2. Pairing and Peer Review</a></h4></div>
<p>
Pairing and peer review create built-in quality during development. 
Peer review provides feedback on another team member's work before release. 
When pairing, two or more team members work on the same item together. 
Both create and maintain quality because the work will contain knowledge, perspectives, and best practices from multiple members. 
They also raise and broaden the skillset for the entire team as teammates learn from each other. 
Pairing and peer review create built-in quality during development. 
Peer review provides feedback on another team members work before release. 
When pairing, two or more team members work on the same item together. 
Both create and maintain quality because the work will contain knowledge, perspectives, and best practices from multiple members. 
They also raise and broaden the skillset for the entire team as teammates learn from each other.
Teams often apply both practices, with some teams pairing frequently. 
Other teams use reviews for feedback and pair when addressing a challenging problem or performing an activity that requires diverse skills. 
Regardless of the approach, all artifacts are subject to multiple sets of eyes and perspectives before ever being accepted or released.            
</p>
    
<div id="4 SAFe Core Values-2. Built-in Quality-5 dimensions-3. Collective Ownership and Standards"><h4 id="3. Collective Ownership and Standards" class="header"><a href="#4 SAFe Core Values-2. Built-in Quality-5 dimensions-3. Collective Ownership and Standards">3. Collective Ownership and Standards</a></h4></div>
<p>
Collective ownership means that anyone can change an artifact to improve its quality. 
This reduces dependencies between and within teams, and ensures that a members absence doesn't block progress.
Because the work is not owned by one team or individual, standards are required to assure consistency, enabling everyone to understand and maintain the quality of each work product. 
Standards also provide lightweight governance to help assure that individuals don't make a local change that has an unintended, system-level consequence.
</p>

<div id="4 SAFe Core Values-2. Built-in Quality-5 dimensions-4. Automation"><h4 id="4. Automation" class="header"><a href="#4 SAFe Core Values-2. Built-in Quality-5 dimensions-4. Automation">4. Automation</a></h4></div>
<p>
Agile teams automate repetitive, manual tasks to increase speed and ensure they are performed accurately and consistently. 
Teams typically automate in two ways.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
They automate the processes that build, deploy, and release the solution. 
    This process takes the teams' raw artifacts (code, models, images, content, etc.), 
    generates production versions as necessary, 
    integrates them across teams, and 
    makes them available in a production environment.

<li>
They automate the quality checks along this path to ensure standards are followed, artifacts meet quality levels (e.g., broken link and spelling checkers), etc.

</ol>

<div id="4 SAFe Core Values-2. Built-in Quality-5 dimensions-5. Definition of Done"><h4 id="5. Definition of Done" class="header"><a href="#4 SAFe Core Values-2. Built-in Quality-5 dimensions-5. Definition of Done">5. Definition of Done</a></h4></div>
<p>
Agreeing on a definition of done (DoD) is a standard way 
to ensure that artifacts and larger increments of value can only be considered finished
when they demonstrate the agreed level of quality and completeness.
Teams use the DoD to ensure they agree on and follow a common set of practices when completing work.
These agreements align teams around what quality means and how it is built into the solution.
Examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Work must be peer-reviewed

<li>
All quality tests must be passed successfully using a checklist

<li>
All associated files in an email must be checked-in and in the appropriate shared repository.

<li>
Notifications are sent internally to notify stakeholders that the email was released.

</ul>

Leading Change

<ul>
<li>
Change vision occurs when leaders communicate why change is needed and do so in ways that inspire, motivate, and engage people.

<li>
Change leadership is the ability to positively influence and motivate others to engage in the organizational change through the leader’s own personal advocacy and drive.

<li>
A powerful coalition for change is formed when individuals from multiple levels and across silos are empowered and have the influence necessary to effectively lead the change.

<li>
Psychological safety occurs when leaders create an environment for risk-taking that supports change without fear of negative consequences to self-image, status, or career.

<li>
Training the new way of working ensures that everyone is trained in the values, principles, and practices of Lean and Agile, including a commitment by leaders to their own training so they can lead by example.

Phase-Gate Milestones

<li>
4 critical errors of Phase-Gate Milestones

<ol>
<li>
Centralizing requirements and design decisions in siloed functions that do not actually build the system.

<li>
Forcing too-early design decisions and false-positive feasibility.

<li>
Assuming a point solution exists and can be built correctly the first time.

<li>
Making up-front decisions creates large batches of requirements, code, and tests, and long queues.

<ul>
<li>
Improved economics

<ul>
<li>
Without uncommitted objectives, a team is committing to a 100 percent scope in a fixed timebox. 

<li>
This forces teams to trade off quality or build other buffers into the system. 

<li>
The other buffers can accumulate, and convert ‘uncertain earliness to certain lateness’, resulting in less overall throughput.

</ul>
</ul>
	
<ul>
<li>
Increased reliability

<ul>
<li>
Uncommitted objectives represent variable scope, allowing confidence in the delivery of the main priorities. 

<li>
In turn, delivering on the stated commitments is the most important factor in building trust between the teams and the stakeholders.

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Adaptability to change

<ul>
<li>
To reliably deliver on a cadence, uncommitted objectives provide the capacity margin needed to meet commitments, yet alter priorities if necessary, when fact patterns change.

</ul>
</ul>

Value Stream Management

<ul>
<li>
Value stream management (VSM) is a business practice that focuses on increasing the flow of business value from customer request to customer delivery.

<li>
value stream mapping, analyzing flow efficiency through the end-to-end delivery pipeline, and setting targets for delivery speed, quality, and value

</ul>
<li>
Continuous Quality

<ul>
<li>
In DevOps, practices that ensure high solution quality do not simply shift left, they extend to all activities in the value stream. 

<li>
Continuous Quality is a domain that ensures that quality is built in early in the pipeline and continually managed throughout a solution’s life cycle.

<li>
hypothesis-driven development

<li>
behavior-driven design (BDD)

<li>
test-driven development (TDD)

<li>
A/B testing

<li>
exploratory testing

</ul>
<li>
Continuous Security

<ul>
<li>
security is everyone’s responsibility. 

<li>
This domain spans the entire continuous delivery pipeline and ensures that sound information security practices—both preventive and detective—are always active throughout the life cycle of a solution.

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
security by design

<li>
threat modeling

<li>

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Version Control

<ul>
<li>
To achieve quantum leaps in pipeline acceleration and quality control, DevOps requires all solution assets to be under version control. 

<li>
Application code; server, network, and firewall configurations; database scripts; even requirements and test scripts need to be stored in a common repository to ensure solutions and environments can be built, deployed, repaired, and decommissioned on demand.

<li>
Version Control stresses minimizing the amount and duration of open branches and ensuring that the code base always remains in a deployable state. Automation in this category is directed toward optimizing branching and merging strategies, facilitating distributed version control, and managing file types of all kinds.

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Configuration Management

<ul>
<li>
a set of design-time practices

<li>
Configuration Management is a large part of the ‘what’ to Version Control’s ‘how.’ 

<li>
The things that are stored in version control are configurations, such as application, database, infrastructure, and security configurations. 

<li>
Since these configurations collectively represent all design time and runtime aspects of a solution, they must be carefully managed.

<li>
infrastructure-as-code

<li>
security-as-code

<li>
compliance-as-code 

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Infrastructure Management

<ul>
<li>
a set of runtime practices

<li>
Infrastructure Management is a domain that focuses on the ‘care and feeding’ of production systems, many of which may be defined as code. 

<li>
Whereas configuration management is , 

<li>
This domain is primarily concerned with ensuring the stability and resiliency of deployed solutions so that maximum value can be realized. 

<li>
chaos engineering

<li>
selective releases

<li>
site reliability engineering (SRE). 

<li>
Automation is applied to enable immutable infrastructure, release on demand, rapid recovery, and auto-scaling.

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Agile Planning and Design

<ul>
<li>
The Agile Planning and Design domain assures that a CALMR approach to DevOps is followed from the onset of the delivery life cycle. 

<li>
Lean UX

<li>
Agile architecture

<li>
backlog management

<li>
emergent design.

<li>
Tools focus primarily on streamlining Agile practices, making work visible, and accelerating the productivity of individuals and teams.

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Deployment Pipeline

<ul>
<li>
Arguably the most popular area of concentration in DevOps is what is popularly known as the ‘CI/CD pipeline.’ 

<li>
This is the segment of the value stream that begins with code committed to version control and ends with that code being successfully deployed in production. 

<li>
Because the goal is to deploy finished code to production as quickly and safely as possible, SAFe’s term for this subset of the value stream is the Deployment Pipeline.

<li>
Ultimately, the entire deployment pipeline should be automated from end to end using a carefully selected tool chain. 

<li>
Doing so greatly accelerates build, integration, testing, break fix, and deployment cycles. 

<li>
Often the only manual activities in a mature deployment pipeline are 

<ul>
<li>
peer reviews

<li>
responding to system-generated pipeline events and notifications.

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Continuous Monitoring

<ul>
<li>
capturing, logging, surfacing, and analyzing production events. These events describe both system behavior and end user behavior and directly support the Measurement and Recovery elements of CALMR.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
customer centricity

<li>

<li>
this domain ensures that the continuous delivery pipeline is always calibrated to deliver specific, measurable business outcomes. 

<li>
ensures that the enterprise collects validated learning from every release and directs those learnings toward relentless improvement.

<li>

<li>
allows the organization to respond, rollback, or fix forward when necessary.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
separates the deployment and release process.

</ul>
<p>
This promotes design thinking practices and the flow of value by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Targeting functionality to specific customers – Separating deployment from release enables the organization to target customers with specific functionality, allowing the organization to assess the impact of the release before deploying functionality to all customers.

<li>
Promoting experimentation, such as A/B Testing – Design thinking practices, such as A/B Testing, require the ability to present different functionality to targeted users, gathering the data that helps create designs optimized for user needs.

<li>
Promoting small batches – Prior choices made in the pipeline, such as automated testing, make deploying in small batches easier.

<li>
Releasing on business needs – Enterprises tend to release infrequently when deploying a release is complex and error-prone. Conversely, when deployment and release are separated, and investments are made to ensure both are automated and low-risk, enterprises can release on demand, substantially increasing business agility. For example, a release can be in production ahead of a marketing milestone, giving the organization complete flexibility in maximizing all aspects of the delivery of value.
