<li>
Management has the ultimate responsibility for business outcomes. 

<li>
Leaders are trained in SAFe and become trainers of these leaner and more agile ways of thinking and working.

<li>
technology revolutions radically alter society, 

<ul>
<li>
first via a mass movement in financial (investment) capital, 

<li>
which then results in new production capital (goods and services). 

<li>
Massive societal change, disruption, and a new economic order sets in. 

</ul>
<li>
These are truly ‘world-shaking’ disruptions that occur with three distinct phases:

<ul>
<li>
Installation Period – New technology and financial capital combine to create a ‘Cambrian explosion’ (a geological term for a relatively short time over which a large diversity of life forms appeared) of new entrants.

<li>
Turning Point – Existing business either master the new technology or decline and become relics of the last age

<li>
Deployment Period – Production capital of the new technological giants starts to take over

</ul>

<p>
Creating flow requires eliminating the traditional sequential phase gates planning and execution that hinder progress. 
Instead, teams visualize and focus their efforts on smaller deliverables to shepherd new pieces of functionality from ideation to an on-demand release of value to the end user. 
Unlike traditional project management, where success is measured by completing an entire initiative on time and on budget, 
Agile teams quickly release small deliverables to learn and adapt, basing success on objective evaluation. 
Small features flow through the system quickly to provide feedback and allow course correction.
</p>

<div id="4 SAFe Core Values-2. Built-in Quality-5 dimensions-2. Pairing and Peer Review"><h4 id="2. Pairing and Peer Review" class="header"><a href="#4 SAFe Core Values-2. Built-in Quality-5 dimensions-2. Pairing and Peer Review">2. Pairing and Peer Review</a></h4></div>
<p>
Pairing and peer review create built-in quality during development. 
Peer review provides feedback on another team member's work before release. 
When pairing, two or more team members work on the same item together. 
Both create and maintain quality because the work will contain knowledge, perspectives, and best practices from multiple members. 
They also raise and broaden the skillset for the entire team as teammates learn from each other. 
Pairing and peer review create built-in quality during development. 
Peer review provides feedback on another team members work before release. 
When pairing, two or more team members work on the same item together. 
Both create and maintain quality because the work will contain knowledge, perspectives, and best practices from multiple members. 
They also raise and broaden the skillset for the entire team as teammates learn from each other.
Teams often apply both practices, with some teams pairing frequently. 
Other teams use reviews for feedback and pair when addressing a challenging problem or performing an activity that requires diverse skills. 
Regardless of the approach, all artifacts are subject to multiple sets of eyes and perspectives before ever being accepted or released.            
</p>
    
<div id="4 SAFe Core Values-2. Built-in Quality-5 dimensions-3. Collective Ownership and Standards"><h4 id="3. Collective Ownership and Standards" class="header"><a href="#4 SAFe Core Values-2. Built-in Quality-5 dimensions-3. Collective Ownership and Standards">3. Collective Ownership and Standards</a></h4></div>
<p>
Collective ownership means that anyone can change an artifact to improve its quality. 
This reduces dependencies between and within teams, and ensures that a members absence doesn't block progress.
Because the work is not owned by one team or individual, standards are required to assure consistency, enabling everyone to understand and maintain the quality of each work product. 
Standards also provide lightweight governance to help assure that individuals don't make a local change that has an unintended, system-level consequence.
</p>

<div id="4 SAFe Core Values-2. Built-in Quality-5 dimensions-4. Automation"><h4 id="4. Automation" class="header"><a href="#4 SAFe Core Values-2. Built-in Quality-5 dimensions-4. Automation">4. Automation</a></h4></div>
<p>
Agile teams automate repetitive, manual tasks to increase speed and ensure they are performed accurately and consistently. 
Teams typically automate in two ways.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
They automate the processes that build, deploy, and release the solution. 
    This process takes the teams' raw artifacts (code, models, images, content, etc.), 
    generates production versions as necessary, 
    integrates them across teams, and 
    makes them available in a production environment.

<li>
They automate the quality checks along this path to ensure standards are followed, artifacts meet quality levels (e.g., broken link and spelling checkers), etc.

</ol>

<div id="4 SAFe Core Values-2. Built-in Quality-5 dimensions-5. Definition of Done"><h4 id="5. Definition of Done" class="header"><a href="#4 SAFe Core Values-2. Built-in Quality-5 dimensions-5. Definition of Done">5. Definition of Done</a></h4></div>

Definition of Done-definition-of-done"></span><span class="tag" id="definition-of-done">definition-of-done</span>
Agreeing on a definition of done (DoD) is a standard way 
to ensure that artifacts and larger increments of value can only be considered finished
when they demonstrate the agreed level of quality and completeness.
Teams use the DoD to ensure they agree on and follow a common set of practices when completing work.
These agreements align teams around what quality means and how it is built into the solution.
Examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Work must be peer-reviewed

<li>
All quality tests must be passed successfully using a checklist

<li>
All associated files in an email must be checked-in and in the appropriate shared repository.

<li>
Notifications are sent internally to notify stakeholders that the email was released.

</ul>

Leading Change

<ul>
<li>
Leaders lead (rather than support) the transformation by creating the environment, preparing the people, and providing the necessary resources to realize the desired outcomes.

<li>
Change vision occurs when leaders communicate why change is needed and do so in ways that inspire, motivate, and engage people.

<li>
Change leadership is the ability to positively influence and motivate others to engage in the organizational change through the leader’s own personal advocacy and drive.

<li>
A powerful coalition for change is formed when individuals from multiple levels and across silos are empowered and have the influence necessary to effectively lead the change.

<li>
Psychological safety occurs when leaders create an environment for risk-taking that supports change without fear of negative consequences to self-image, status, or career.

<li>
Training the new way of working ensures that everyone is trained in the values, principles, and practices of Lean and Agile, including a commitment by leaders to their own training so they can lead by example.

5 considerations that affect decisions for what to build and how and when to build it
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Development expense – the cost of labor and materials required to implement a capability

<li>
Lead time – the time needed to implement the capability (described as ‘Cycle time’ in Reinertsen’s work)

<li>
Product cost – the manufacturing cost (of goods sold) and/or deployment and operational costs

<li>
Value – the economic worth of the capability to the business and the customer

<li>
Risk – the uncertainty of the solution’s technical or business success

</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Leveraging suppliers

</ol>

<li>
Sequencing jobs for the maximum benefit

</ol>

risk

<li>
cost of delay

4 critical errors of Phase-Gate Milestones

<ol>
<li>
Centralizing requirements and design decisions in siloed functions that do not actually build the system.

<li>
Forcing too-early design decisions and false-positive feasibility.

<li>
Assuming a point solution exists and can be built correctly the first time.

<li>
Making up-front decisions creates large batches of requirements, code, and tests, and long queues.

<p>
Pre- and Post-PI Planning events are used for preparation and coordination of PI planning across multiple ARTs and Suppliers in a Solution Train. 
The purpose of these events is to create a common Vision and mission, and align around a set of features and Capabilities that will advance the solution.
</p>

<div id="Program Increment-Solution Train PI Execution-Pre-PI planning event"><h3 id="Pre-PI planning event" class="header"><a href="#Program Increment-Solution Train PI Execution-Pre-PI planning event">Pre-PI planning event</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
integrate the results from each ART PI planning event, manage identified risks and dependencies, and update the Roadmap for the Solution Train.

</ul>
<p>
At the end of the post-PI planning event, there should be a commitment to an agreed set of solution-level PI objectives to be implemented by the end of the PI.
</p>

<div id="Program Increment-Solution Train PI Execution-Solution Increment and Solution Demo"><h3 id="Solution Increment and Solution Demo" class="header"><a href="#Program Increment-Solution Train PI Execution-Solution Increment and Solution Demo">Solution Increment and Solution Demo</a></h3></div>

<p>
During the PI timebox, the ARTs build multiple increments of value, which grow into solution capabilities. 
The new capabilities must be designed, developed, tested, and validated holistically, along with the existing capabilities of the solution. 
The solution demo is a critical aspect of the PI learning cycle for a Solution Train. 
This high-profile event allows large solution stakeholders, customers (or their internal proxies), and senior management to view the progress that the Solution Train has made during the PI.
</p>

<p>
At this event, the Solution Train demos its accomplishments for the entire PI. Senior managers and stakeholders review the progress in the broader solution context. It may also inform decisions about whether to pivot or persevere with capabilities, as well as changes to Lean Budgets for the various Value Streams.
</p>

<div id="Program Increment-Solution Train PI Execution-Solution Train Inspect and Adapt"><h3 id="Solution Train Inspect and Adapt" class="header"><a href="#Program Increment-Solution Train PI Execution-Solution Train Inspect and Adapt">Solution Train Inspect and Adapt</a></h3></div>
<p>
At the end of the PI, an additional I&amp;A event may be required at the Large Solution Level. It follows the same format as the I&amp;A for the ART. 
Due to the number of people involved, attendees at the Solution Train I&amp;A cannot include everyone from the ARTs, so the best-suited representatives are selected to address that context. 
This includes the primary stakeholders of the Solution Train, as well as representatives from the various ARTs and suppliers.

<ul>
<li>
Improved economics

<ul>
<li>
Without uncommitted objectives, a team is committing to a 100 percent scope in a fixed timebox. 

<li>
This forces teams to trade off quality or build other buffers into the system. 

<li>
The other buffers can accumulate, and convert ‘uncertain earliness to certain lateness’, resulting in less overall throughput.

</ul>
</ul>
	
<ul>
<li>
Increased reliability

<ul>
<li>
Uncommitted objectives represent variable scope, allowing confidence in the delivery of the main priorities. 

<li>
In turn, delivering on the stated commitments is the most important factor in building trust between the teams and the stakeholders.

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Adaptability to change

<ul>
<li>
To reliably deliver on a cadence, uncommitted objectives provide the capacity margin needed to meet commitments, yet alter priorities if necessary, when fact patterns change.

</ul>
</ul>

Note:
In multi-ART Solution Trains, a similar event may be held after the first day of planning to resolve cross-ART issues that have come up. Alternatively, the RTEs of the involved trains may talk with each other to raise issues that are then resolved in each ART’s specific management review and problem-solving meeting. The Solution Train Engineer (STE) helps facilitate and resolve issues across the ARTs.

the team states their risks and impediments and provides the risks to the RTE for use later in the ROAMing exercise. 

</ul>
<li>
The team then asks the Business Owners if the plan is acceptable. 

<ul>
<li>
If the plan is accepted the team brings their team PI objective sheet to the front of the room so everyone can see the aggregate objectives unfold in real-time. 

<li>
If the Business Owners have concerns, teams are given the opportunity to adjust the plan as needed to address the issues identified.

<ul>
<li>
Resolved – The teams agree that the risk is no longer a concern.

<li>
Owned – Someone on the train takes ownership of the risk since it cannot be resolved during PI planning.

<li>
Accepted – Some risks are just facts or potential problems that must be understood and accepted.

<li>
Mitigated – Teams identify a plan to reduce the impact of the risk.

<li>
Confidence vote facilitate by RTE

<ul>
<li>
fist of five vote

<li>
If the average is three fingers or above, then management should accept the commitment. 

<li>
If it’s less than three, the team reworks the plan. 

<li>
Any person voting two fingers or fewer should be given an opportunity to voice their concerns. 

<li>
This might add to the list of risks, require some re-planning, or simply be informative. 

<li>
Once each team has voted,

<li>
the process is repeated for the entire ART with everyone expressing their confidence in the collective plan

</ul>

Execution of the PI begins with all the teams conducting planning for the first iteration, using their PI plans as a starting point.

Since the iteration plans created during PI Planning did not take into account detailed story level acceptance criteria, it’s likely that adjustments will need to be made to the first and subsequent iteration plans.

The company is failing to compete, 

<li>
existing way of doing business is obviously inadequate to achieve a new solution within a survivable time frame. 

<li>
Jobs are at stake. 

</ul>

<p>
This is the easier case for change. 
While there will always be those who are resistant, 
they are likely to be overcome by the wave of energy 
that drives a sense of urgency for mandatory change through the organization.

<ul>
<li>
leadership must drive change proactively by taking a stand for a better future state. 

<li>
Lean-Agile Leaders must exhibit what Toyota [2] would call “a constant sense of danger” 
	— a never-ending sense of potential crisis that fuels continuous improvement. 

</ul>

<p>
This is often the less obvious reason to drive change, 
as the people in the organization may not see or feel the urgency to do the additional hard work that comes with change. 
After all, they are successful now. Why should they assume that they won’t continue to be successful in the future? 
Isn’t change risky? 
</p>

<p>
In this case, leaders must create a clear and compelling vision for change that answers why change is needed [3]. 
They must constantly communicate and impress the need for change on all, making it clear that maintaining the status quo is simply unacceptable.

Strong leadership is needed to successfully implement any change in an organization. 
In the context of SAFe, some of these leaders will provide direct and ongoing sponsorship for the change by participating in the LACE; 
others will be directly involved in implementing SAFe or be leading, managing, and influencing the other players in the transformation. 
Their role could include participating directly in launching Agile Release Trains (ARTs). 
Or, it could mean that they will work at higher levels to eliminate impediments that arise in the company’s current governance, culture, and practices.
All of these stakeholders need the knowledge and skills to lead—rather than to follow—the implementation.

The SAFe Big Picture shows a 10-week PI, which consists of four regular iterations and one Innovation and Planning (IP) iteration. 

<li>
There is no fixed rule for the PI cadence, nor for how much time should be reserved for the IP iteration. 

<li>
The recommended duration of a PI is between 8 to 12 weeks, with a bias toward the shorter duration (10 weeks, for example). 

<li>
Once the cadence is chosen, it should remain stable and not arbitrarily change from one PI to another. 

<ul>
<li>
allows the ART to have a predictable rhythm and velocity.

<p>
Product Managers and Product Owners steer the train together. 
They have content authority over features and stories, respectively. 
These two roles are critical to the success of the ART, and the people fulfilling these roles must be well trained to ensure optimal collaboration, learn the new way of working, and understand how to best fulfill their specific responsibilities. 
In addition, these roles will be largely responsible for building the initial program backlog, which is a key artifact for PI planning.
</p>

<p>
Scaled Agile, Inc.’s two-day SAFe Product Owner/Product Manager course is designed specifically for this purpose. 
The course teaches Product Owners and Product (and Solution) Managers how to drive the delivery of value in the SAFe enterprise. 
Attendees get an overview of SAFe’s Lean-Agile Mindset and principles, as well as an in-depth exploration of role-specific practices. 
Attendees learn how to write Epics, Features, and User Stories, how to establish the Team and Program Kanban systems to manage the flow of work, and how to manage and prioritize backlogs using Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF).

<p>
Effective ARTs, in large part, rely on the servant leadership of the Scrum Master and their ability to coach Agile Team members and improve the performance of the team. 
It’s a specialty role that includes traditional Scrum leadership duties, as well as responsibilities to the larger team-of-Agile-teams that constitute the ART. 
In SAFe, Scrum Masters also play a critical role in PI planning and help coordinate value delivery through Scrum of Scrums events. 
Obviously, it’s incredibly helpful if they receive appropriate training prior to the start of the first PI.
</p>

<p>
Scaled Agile, Inc.’s two-day SAFe Scrum Master course teaches Scrum fundamentals and also explores the role of Scrum in the context of SAFe. 
It prepares Scrum Masters for how to facilitate team iterations, how to successfully plan and execute the PI, how to participate in ART events, and how to measure and improve the flow of work through the system using Kanban. 
This course is beneficial for both new and experienced Scrum Masters.

<p>
System Architects/Engineers support solution development by providing, communicating and evolving the broader technology and architectural view of the solution.  
In so doing, they enable Agile teams to make effective, decentralized decisions that accelerate the creation of business value, while ensuring that the solution’s architecture remains robust and sustainable.  
Individuals fulfilling these roles must not only be experienced technical experts but must be effective Lean-Agile Leaders skilled at engaging across the organization.  
Partnering with Product Management, this role takes on, defines and owns enabler features in the backlog designed to maintain the architectural runway necessary to sustain business value creation.
</p>

<p>
Scaled Agile, Inc.’s three-day SAFe System and Solution Architect course teaches senior technical contributors the role of architecture in a Lean-Agile enterprise.  
Attendees will explore the principles underlying Lean-Agile architecture and Release on Demand, learn to lead and support Solution Trains and Agile Release Trains, extend the principles driving continuous flow to large systems of systems, and discover how to enable an improved flow of value across an entire portfolio.

<p>
Training people in their new roles and responsibilities is a key part of ART readiness, but it’s only one element of a successful ART launch. 
Additional activities are required. 
However, since SAFe is based on the empirical Plan-Do-Check-Adjust (PDCA) model, there is no such thing as perfect readiness for a launch. 
Even attempting to achieve such a state is a fool’s errand, as the experience of the first PI will inform future activities. 
What’s more, trying to be too perfect up-front will delay learning, postponing the transformation and realization of its benefits.
</p>

<p>
That said, a certain degree of readiness will help assure a more successful planning event the first time.

<p>
In some rollouts, training is performed team-by-team over time. That can sometimes be effective. However, a more accelerated approach is strongly recommended, which includes training all the team members at the same time. This practice has raised some eyebrows in the industry. Many picture 100-plus people in a room being trained simultaneously, compare it to the more intimate setting of a small team with a single instructor, and can’t imagine that it delivers equivalent benefits. In reality, it delivers far more value, for example:
</p>
<blockquote>
Accelerated learning – This training happens in two days, rather than over a period of months. That speeds up the timing and assimilation by all the members of the train, which accelerates the launch.
A common scaled Agile paradigm – All team members receive the same training, at the same time, from the same instructor. This eliminates the variability of different training sessions over time, by different instructors, using different courseware.
Cost-efficiency – One of the challenges with Agile implementation at scale has been the availability and expense of training. Talented, proven instructors are hard to find and not consistently available, and their value and cost are commensurately high. The Big Room approach is typically three to five times more cost-effective than individual team training.
Collective learning – There is no substitute for the learning experience of big room training. Face-to-face interaction is one of the critical ingredients of Agile at scale. Training everyone together starts building the social network that the ART relies upon and creates a far better experience than what can be accomplished when working separately from each other. There can be a transformative aspect to it, something you have to experience to believe.

<p>
three elements to this approach:
</p>
<blockquote>
Day 1 – 2 – The Agile team big room training takes place, as described above.
Day 3 – 4 – Team training is followed immediately by PI planning. This way, the teams are still present and in context and their first PI planning experience builds on the prior day’s training.
Day 5 – This day is reserved for mentoring people in their new roles, tool training, discussion of needed Agile technical practices, open space, and any other activities that the teams need to get ready for the first iteration.

<p>
You just finished the ART launch--now showcase its success.
The PI Planning event itself is a short-term win, as it creates clear commitment to goals.
Next, it's important to showcase that the ART is meeting its PI Objectives and relentlessly improving its program performance.
Invite stakeholders and showcase the success of the Team Demos and System Demos, as well as the PI System Demo.
Communicate real wins, not gimmicks.
The first PI is the most crucial to lead. 
Existing team, program, and organizational issues become highly visible. 
You must have confidence and clarity.
You will provide ongoing program consulting and team coaching to build the organization's Lean-Agile capabilities.

<p>
Next, shift to the Continuous Delivery Pipeline and the enterprise competency of Agile Product Delivery.  
This involves both managing and continuously improving the speed and quality of the ART’s capability to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Continuously Explore:  Sense and respond to market/business needs to build and maintain the program Vision, Roadmap, Backlog and Architectural Runway.

<li>
Continuously Integrate:  Build, validate and learn from working system increments

<li>
Continuously Deploy:  Deliver validated features into production, where they are ready for release

</ul>

<p>
The Program Kanban is the primary tool for visualizing and managing the continuous delivery pipeline, 
while 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
DevOps, 

<li>
Value Stream Mapping, and 

<li>
the Problem Solving Workshop 

</ul>
<p>
are the coach’s primary tools for enhancing these capabilities.
</p>

<p>
The SAFe DevOps course can be used as a foundation for these practices during the 1st Innovation &amp; Planning iteration, or for continuing education during subsequent PIs as the need and opportunity dictates, to accelerate development of this competency.

Clearly stating the problem is key to problem identification and correction

<li>
You must define the undesirable problem or situation, so everyone involved in the countermeasures understands

<li>
A clearly defined problem focuses your investigation efforts and saves time. Honest effort at careful definition will avoid the 'ready, fire, aim' approach that is so common in problem-solving

<li>
A problem that is not well-defined may result in failure to reach the proper countermeasure

</ul>

By repeating why five times, the nature of the problem, as well as its solution, becomes clear. --Taiichi Ohno
The Five Whys is a proven problem-solving technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem
</p>

<p>
The key is to avoid assumptions and logic traps
Instead, trace the chain of causality in direct increments from the effect to a root cause
</p>

<p>
Vote on the root causes

Identify the biggest root-cause using Pareto analysis

</ol>
<p>
Pareto analysis ­ Identify the biggest root cause
Also known as the 80/20 rule, the Pareto analysis is a statistical decision technique used to narrow down the number of actions that produce the most significant overall effect
It uses the principle that 20% of root causes can cause 80% of problems
It is useful where many possible sources and actions are competing
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Restate the new problem for the biggest root-cause

</ol>
<p>
Step 1: Dot vote to identify the biggest root cause on your chart
Step 2: Use Pareto analysis to identify the biggest root cause. Put it under the Biggest Root Cause heading on the problem-solving board
Step 3: Restate the problem to address the identified root cause, including the economic impact of the problem under the Restate problem heading on the problem-solving board
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Brainstorm solutions

</ol>
<p>
Step 1: Individually brainstorm and write ideas on sticky notes and put them up on the board
Step 2: After all ideas are captured, discuss them as a team
Step 3: Organize ideas into affinity groups  
Step 4: Dot vote to identify the top contenders to put in the Identify Improvement Backlog Items heading on the problem-solving board
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Identify improvement backlog items

</ol>
<p>
Step 1: Select a person from your team to do a readout
Step 2: Start the readout by stating the original problem and conclude with the proposed improvement backlog items

<p>
When several related products or solutions can be produced with a relatively small number of people, a single ART may deliver multiple value streams.
</p>

<div id="Agile Release Train-3 ART designs-A single development value stream can fit within an ART"><h3 id="A single development value stream can fit within an ART" class="header"><a href="#Agile Release Train-3 ART designs-A single development value stream can fit within an ART">A single development value stream can fit within an ART</a></h3></div>
<p>
Often, a Value Stream can be realized with 100 or fewer practitioners. 
Many development groups are already organized into units of about that size, so this is a common case. 
In this case, the ART is roughly the same as the value stream. 
Everyone is in that ART!
</p>

<p>
Large development value streams are very common in large enterprises and often some additional analysis is required. 
When possible, trains should be focused on a single, primary solution, or a set of closely related products or services in that value stream. 
</p>

<p>
This is a fairly simple design—one ART delivering a well-defined set of valuable things.
</p>

<p>
However, in the case where many people are needed to deliver a single solution, multiple ARTs will need to collaborate as part of a <a href="index.html#Solution Train">#Solution Train</a>. 
To support the overall goal of continuous value delivery to the customer, each ART within the <a href="index.html#Solution Train">#Solution Train</a> must be designed to maximize flow across the entire Solution Train

<p>
SAFe practices are grounded in fundamental Lean-Agile Principles. 
As organizations adopt SAFe, their continuous improvement activities find even better ways of working.  
These principles guide those improvement efforts and ensure the adjustments are moving on a continuous path to the shortest sustainable lead time, with the best quality and value to people and society.

<p>
Real Agile Teams and ARTs are fully cross-functional. 
They have everything, and everyone, necessary to produce a working, tested increment of the solution. 
They are self-organizing and self-managing, which enables value to flow more quickly, with a minimum of overhead. 
Agile teams that cannot define, build, and test their work are not true Agile teams. 
ARTs that cannot deliver solutions or part of them are not true ARTs.

<div id="Ten Critical ART Success Factors-#3 – Cadence and Synchronization"><h2 id="#3 – Cadence and Synchronization" class="header"><a href="#Ten Critical ART Success Factors-#3 – Cadence and Synchronization">#3 – Cadence and Synchronization</a></h2></div>
<p>
Cadence provides a rhythmic pattern, which offers a steady heartbeat for the development process.
It makes routine those things that can be routine. 
Synchronization allows multiple perspectives to be understood and resolved at the same time. 
For example, synchronization is used to pull the various assets of a system together to assess solution-level viability.
</p>

<div id="Ten Critical ART Success Factors-#4 – PI Planning"><h2 id="#4 – PI Planning" class="header"><a href="#Ten Critical ART Success Factors-#4 – PI Planning">#4 – PI Planning</a></h2></div>
<p>
No event is more powerful in SAFe than Program Increment (PI) planning. 
It provides the rhythm for the ART and connects strategy to execution by ensuring business and technology alignment. 
Aligning the entire ART on a common vision and goal creates substantial energy and a shared sense of purpose.

<div id="Ten Critical ART Success Factors-#5 – Customer Centricity, DevOps and Release on Demand"><h2 id="#5 – Customer Centricity, DevOps and Release on Demand" class="header"><a href="#Ten Critical ART Success Factors-#5 – Customer Centricity, DevOps and Release on Demand">#5 – Customer Centricity, DevOps and Release on Demand</a></h2></div>
<p>
SAFe enterprises create a positive customer experience across their full set of products and services.  
They adopt a DevOps mindset, culture, and applicable technical practices to enable more frequent and higher-quality releases as the market demands.  
These practices provide faster validation of hypotheses and produce greater profits, increased employee engagement, and more satisfied customers
</p>

<div id="Ten Critical ART Success Factors-#6 – System Demo"><h2 id="#6 – System Demo" class="header"><a href="#Ten Critical ART Success Factors-#6 – System Demo">#6 – System Demo</a></h2></div>
<p>
The primary measure of the ART’s progress is the objective evidence provided by a working solution in the System Demo. 
Every two weeks, the full system - the integrated work of all teams on the train for that iteration—is demoed to the train’s stakeholders. 
Stakeholders provide the feedback the train needs to stay on course and take corrective action.  
This replaces other forms of governance that create additional work and slow flow.
</p>

<div id="Ten Critical ART Success Factors-#7 – Inspect and Adapt"><h2 id="#7 – Inspect and Adapt" class="header"><a href="#Ten Critical ART Success Factors-#7 – Inspect and Adapt">#7 – Inspect and Adapt</a></h2></div>
<p>
Inspect and Adapt is a significant event held every PI. 
It is a regular time to reflect, collect data, and solve problems. 
The inspect and adapt event assembles teams and stakeholders to assess the solution and define improvements and actions needed to increase the velocity, quality, and reliability of the next PI.
</p>

<div id="Ten Critical ART Success Factors-#8 – IP Iteration"><h2 id="#8 – IP Iteration" class="header"><a href="#Ten Critical ART Success Factors-#8 – IP Iteration">#8 – IP Iteration</a></h2></div>
<p>
The Innovation and Planning Iteration occurs every PI and serves multiple purposes. 
It acts as an estimating buffer for meeting PI objectives, and provides dedicated time for innovation, continuing education, PI Planning, and Inspect and Adapt.  
IP Iteration activities realize many Lean-Agile principles that enable business agility.

<ul>
<li>
consists of the existing code, components, and technical infrastructure necessary to support the implementation of high priority, near-term features, without excessive delay and redesign. 

<li>
Insufficient investment in the architectural runway slows the train and makes the ART’s delivery less predictable.

<p>
For SAFe to be effective, the enterprise’s leaders and managers must take responsibility for Lean-Agile adoption and success. 
Executives and managers must become Lean-Agile leaders who are trained—and then become trainers in—these leaner ways of thinking and operating. 
Without leadership taking responsibility for the implementation, the transformation will likely fail to achieve the full benefits.

<p>
Avoid defining features with the ‘user story voice‘ format that’s designed to support one user role; 
features typically provide functionality for multiple user roles. 
Furthermore, using the same method to describe user stories and features may confuse the business, especially since they are not normally familiar with stories.

 Each development value stream develops one or more Solutions, which are products, services, or systems delivered to the customer, whether internal or external to the Enterprise.

</ul>

<p>
All the words, pages, roles, activities, and artifacts in SAFe exist for only one purpose: to help Agile teams continuously deliver solutions that provide value to their customer. In turn, that enables customers to achieve their goals, which is the pinnacle of applying Design Thinking tools with a Customer-centric mindset.
</p>

<p>
However, even when teams and trains apply SAFe guidance and operate effectively within their disciplines, the value isn’t guaranteed. After all, customers do not buy Capabilities or Features. Rather, they buy whole product solutions that deliver desired outcomes. For that reason, a solution is one of the central concepts in SAFe and requires taking a systems view regarding value delivery.

Empathic design refers to our ability to put aside our preconceived ideas and develop solutions from the perspective of our customers. 
</p>

<p>
User research activities
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Gemba walks (visiting the place where the customer work is done). 

</ul>
<p>
<span id="Customer Centricity-Design with Empathy-gemba-walk"></span><span class="tag" id="gemba-walk">gemba-walk</span>
</p>

<p>
Gemba builds empathy by helping agile teams to gain a deeper understanding of 
the user’s 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
emotional and 

<li>
physical needs

</ul>
<li>
the way they see, 

<li>
understand and 

<li>
interact with the world around them.



<p>
Solution beyond functional needs, also addressing:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Aesthetic and emotional needs

<li>
Ergonomic needs, such as the placement of physical features

<li>
Product attributes that may not be explicitly requested by users, such as performance, security and compliance, but which are essential for viability

<li>
An understanding of how the solution may impact the solution context

<li>
The impact of the solution on related or affected groups

<li>
That the architecture of the solution ensures that operations, maintenance, and support account for the needs of the customer

</ul>

<li>
responsibility to facilitate external interaction and make sure that the “voice of the customer” will be heard, and that 

<li>
the organization will continuously validate new ideas. 

</ul>

<p>
Scope, schedule, and budget for development are generally at the discretion of the internal Business Owners.
</p>

<p>
Customer interaction is typically based on 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
requirements workshops, 

<li>
focus groups, 

<li>
usability testing, and 

<li>
limited beta releases. 

</ul>

<p>
To validate various hypotheses, the solution evolves through feedback from 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
user behavior analysis, 

<li>
metrics, and 

<li>
business intelligence.

</ul>

<div id="Customer Centricity-Degrees of Customer Engagement-Custom-Built Solution"><h3 id="Custom-Built Solution" class="header"><a href="#Customer Centricity-Degrees of Customer Engagement-Custom-Built Solution">Custom-Built Solution</a></h3></div>
<p>
SAFe’s focus on cadence-based development directly supports the collaborations that create the best outcomes in custom-built solutions. 
</p>

<p>
For example, PI Planning provides the time and space to align all stakeholders around the next set of deliverables. 
The successful completion of the Program Increment establishes a high degree of trust in the joint development process and generates data that improves forecasting and economic modeling.

<ul>
<li>
The generic product is often considered the “minimal offering” of a product. 

<li>
The expected product represents the customer’s minimal purchase conditions as informed by alternative or competing products.

<li>
The augmented product goes beyond what is expected and enables competitors to differentiate their offerings.

<li>
The potential product represents everything that might be done to attract and keep customers. Informed by research, it fuels longer-term strategic planning and creates opportunities for sustainable product advantages.

<p>
the value of a release can vary significantly based on when it is released.
</p>

<p>
To create the highest value for all stakeholders, customer-centric organizations leverage market rhythms and market events:
</p>

<p>
<span id="Customer Centricity-Degrees of Customer Engagement-Market Rhythms and Events-market rhythm"></span><strong id="market rhythm">market rhythm</strong> is a set of events that occur repeatedly on a predictable cadence. 
For example, retailers routinely prepare for the holiday shopping season by upgrading their systems to gain a competitive edge to support significantly higher transaction volumes.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Customer Centricity-Degrees of Customer Engagement-Market Rhythms and Events-market event"></span><strong id="market event">market event</strong> is a one-time future event, which has a high probability of materially affecting one or more solutions. 
They can be external, such as the launch of government regulations, or they can be internally created, such as a company’s annual user conference.
</p>

<p>
3 common market events
</p>
<ul>
<li>
the release of new regulations, 

<li>
expected moves of a competitor, and 

<li>
technology changes and upgrades.

</ul>

<p>
Market events are typically represented as milestones, and they strongly impact the timing for releasing solutions. 
They may also inform the content and timing of features or solution development activities identified during Program Increment (PI) planning.

benefits to product teams:

<ul>
<li>
Fast feedback. By definition, a prototype is cheaper and faster to produce than a full solution. This enables faster feedback from users and customers, increased understanding of solution requirements, and greater confidence in the final designs.

<li>
Risk reduction. Prototypes can reduce technical risk by enabling Agile teams to focus initial efforts on the aspects of the solution associated with the highest risk.

<li>
Intellectual property / patent filing. Prototypes can be used to satisfy strategic requirements for managing intellectual property as early as possible in the development process.

<li>
Models for requirements. Prototypes can provide more clarity in the requirements of the desired feature or solution than pages of documentation.

Mid-Fi prototypes are visually-complete representations of software-centric solutions but are not typically functionally integrated.

<li>
Hi-Fi prototypes are visually-complete and interactive models which users and customers can directly explore.

<li>
Hardware prototypes provide critical feedback to the Agile team on such things as form factors, sizes, and operational requirements. 

</ul>

<p>
To help them gain actionable feedback, product teams should strive to leverage the lowest-cost, fastest form of prototyping. 
Often, paper prototyping is the best choice.

</ul>
<li>
Classes of Service 

<ul>
<li>
Standard – Represents the baseline class of service, applicable to work items that are neither expedited nor fixed date. Most backlog items should fall into this category. The CoD is linear for standard items, meaning that value cannot be achieved until delivery occurs, but there’s no specific date by which the work must be completed.

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Fixed date – Describes work items that must be delivered on or before a specific date. Typically, the CoD of these items is nonlinear and is highly sensitive to small changes in the delivery date; these must be actively managed to mitigate the schedule risk. Therefore, these items are pulled into development when necessary to be finished on time. Some items may require additional analysis to refine the expected lead time. Some may need to be reclassified as expedite if the team falls behind.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Expedite – An expedite work item has an unacceptable CoD and therefore requires immediate attention. It can be pulled into development, even if it is in violation of current WIP limits. Typically, there can be only one expedite item in the system at a time and teams may set a policy to swarm on that item to make sure it moves through the system rapidly.

Value Stream Management

<ul>
<li>
Value stream management (VSM) is a business practice that focuses on increasing the flow of business value from customer request to customer delivery.

<li>
value stream mapping, analyzing flow efficiency through the end-to-end delivery pipeline, and setting targets for delivery speed, quality, and value

</ul>
<li>
Continuous Quality

<ul>
<li>
In DevOps, practices that ensure high solution quality do not simply shift left, they extend to all activities in the value stream. 

<li>
Continuous Quality is a domain that ensures that quality is built in early in the pipeline and continually managed throughout a solution’s life cycle.

<li>

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Version Control

<ul>
<li>
To achieve quantum leaps in pipeline acceleration and quality control, DevOps requires all solution assets to be under version control. 

<li>
Application code; server, network, and firewall configurations; database scripts; even requirements and test scripts need to be stored in a common repository to ensure solutions and environments can be built, deployed, repaired, and decommissioned on demand.

<li>
Version Control stresses minimizing the amount and duration of open branches and ensuring that the code base always remains in a deployable state. Automation in this category is directed toward optimizing branching and merging strategies, facilitating distributed version control, and managing file types of all kinds.

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Configuration Management

<ul>
<li>
a set of design-time practices

<li>
Configuration Management is a large part of the ‘what’ to Version Control’s ‘how.’ 

<li>
The things that are stored in version control are configurations, such as application, database, infrastructure, and security configurations. 

<li>
Since these configurations collectively represent all design time and runtime aspects of a solution, they must be carefully managed.

<li>
Deployment Pipeline

<ul>
<li>
Arguably the most popular area of concentration in DevOps is what is popularly known as the ‘CI/CD pipeline.’ 

<li>
This is the segment of the value stream that begins with code committed to version control and ends with that code being successfully deployed in production. 

<li>
Because the goal is to deploy finished code to production as quickly and safely as possible, SAFe’s term for this subset of the value stream is the Deployment Pipeline.

<li>
Ultimately, the entire deployment pipeline should be automated from end to end using a carefully selected tool chain. 

<li>
Doing so greatly accelerates build, integration, testing, break fix, and deployment cycles. 

<li>
Often the only manual activities in a mature deployment pipeline are 

<ul>
<li>
peer reviews

<li>
responding to system-generated pipeline events and notifications.

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Continuous Monitoring

<ul>
<li>
capturing, logging, surfacing, and analyzing production events. These events describe both system behavior and end user behavior and directly support the Measurement and Recovery elements of CALMR.

<ul>
<li>
Process Time is the time it takes to get work done in one step. As an example, in Figure 4, the ‘Design’ step takes four hours.

<li>
Lead Time is the time it takes from when the work was done in the previous step until it’s done in the current step. In other words, Lead Time = Delay Time from Last Step + Process Time of the current step. In Figure 4, the lead time from creating ideas to defining them is variable. It is common when first mapping systems to not have clear metrics on certain steps. In this case, the remaining part of the process can be improved while metrics are gathered on the variable part.

<li>
Delay time is the time when no work is happening. Continuing with Figure 4, the work accepted by the Product Manager is delayed a staggering 696 hours before being deployed to staging. Understanding and eliminating unnecessary delays is critical to improving the flow of value.

<li>
Percent Complete and Accurate (%C&amp;A) represents the percentage of work that the next step can process without needing rework. Often, delays are caused by poor quality in the upstream (prior) steps. The percent complete and accurate metric helps identify the steps where poor quality might be occurring and causing longer lead times, resulting in delays of value delivery. Figure 4 indicates that 20% of the time the work moving from the ‘Design’ step to the ‘Code’ step, needs to be reworked. Improving the %C&amp;A metric is also essential to improving the flow of value. The %C&amp;A of a single step is extended to rolled percent complete and accurate, a measure that captures the likelihood that an item will pass through the entire workflow without rework. With a cumulative rolled %C&amp;A of 35%, this workflow is reworking more than half of its items.

</ul>
<p>
This promotes design thinking practices and the flow of value by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Targeting functionality to specific customers – Separating deployment from release enables the organization to target customers with specific functionality, allowing the organization to assess the impact of the release before deploying functionality to all customers.

<li>
Promoting experimentation, such as A/B Testing – Design thinking practices, such as A/B Testing, require the ability to present different functionality to targeted users, gathering the data that helps create designs optimized for user needs.

<li>
Promoting small batches – Prior choices made in the pipeline, such as automated testing, make deploying in small batches easier.

<li>
Releasing on business needs – Enterprises tend to release infrequently when deploying a release is complex and error-prone. Conversely, when deployment and release are separated, and investments are made to ensure both are automated and low-risk, enterprises can release on demand, substantially increasing <a href="index.html#Business Agility">#Business Agility</a>. For example, a release can be in production ahead of a marketing milestone, giving the organization complete flexibility in maximizing all aspects of the delivery of value.

<p>
	Responsibilities for Large Value Streams
</p>

<p>
		Collaborate with Solution Architect/Engineering – System Architect/Engineering collaborate with Solution Architect/Engineering to ensure discrete solutions created by each ART and supplier fit into and support the larger capabilities and direction of the overall solution. This involves participation in Solution Backlog refinement and prioritization, defining enabler capabilities and NFRs, and assigning architectural responsibilities to the various components and subsystems. A description of the relationship between these roles and the role of the Enterprise Architect can be found in the Enterprise Architect article.
		Participate in Pre- and Post-PI Planning – System Architect/Engineering participates in the pre-PI planning event, working with the Solution Train stakeholders to define the architectural approach, capability roadmap, and high-level objectives for the upcoming PI planning. In the post-PI planning event, System Architect/Engineering helps summarize findings into an agreed-to set of solution PI objectives and validates alignment of the various ART technical directions.
		Participate in the Architect Sync – System Architect/Engineering participates in the Architect Sync to ensure consistency in how emerging designs and tradeoffs are managed across the Solution Train, allowing frequent opportunities to steer implementation approaches without becoming a source of delays.
		Participate in the Solution Demo – System Architect/Engineering participates in the solution demo, often demonstrating the capabilities that their ART has contributed and reviewing the contributions of the other ARTs, taking a systems view with an eye toward fitness for purpose.
		Collaborate with release management – In larger-scale systems, release management also plays a significant role. System Architect/Engineers collaborate with Product Management and key stakeholders on progress, budget, release strategy, and releasability of elements of the solution.
		Aligning technology approaches across ARTs – System Architect/Engineering works actively with the Agile teams to ensure that emergent design choices are made with an understanding of the overall solution and minimize technology complexity and avoid unnecessary duplication of capabilities.

<ol>
<li>
Continually refine the fixed/variable solution intent – The Solution Intent defines many constraints in the form of Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs). Many NFRs are cross-cutting concerns that can be addressed and simplified by intentionally building architectural support for their implementation and testing. Changes in the Solution Intent may create additional work to build more architectural runway or invalidate the existing runway.

<li>
Apply multiple planning horizons – In large solutions, foundational capabilities may take an extended period of time to implement. These systems require a longer architectural runway often implemented with Enabler Epics in the Program and/or Solution Kanban systems.

<li>
Architect for scale, modularity, releaseability, and serviceability – Achieving these goals in large solutions requires intentional architecture to implement an effective Continuous Delivery Pipeline, and ensures simplified operations with strong feedback via application telemetry.

<li>
Continually address compliance concerns – A Lean approach to Compliance automates the testing and generation of compliance data to provide more effective and predictable outcomes. This goal typically requires early engagement with compliance auditors and authorities to agree on an acceptable approach and then creating capabilities through the architectural runway ensures consistency and removes significant compliance risk.

<li>
Evolve deployed systems – A fast, economical Continuous Delivery Pipeline means systems can be released early and evolve. Therefore, systems must be architected to support continuous deployment and release on demand.
